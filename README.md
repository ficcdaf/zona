# Zona

Zona is a small tool for building a static blog website. It allows users to write pages and blog posts in Markdown and automatically build them into a static, lightweight blog.

Zona is quite opinionated about the website structure, since I am mainly building it for my own use. However, this may change as the project develops. 

> **Warning:** Implementing bare minimum basic functionality in Go is still WIP. While this warning is here, Zona is _not_ ready to use! At all!
