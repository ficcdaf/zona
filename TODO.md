# TODO

**Last working on:** I fixed the frontmatter processing; now I should verify that the entire directory is being processed okay.

## Thoroughly test directory processing

- Is the pagedata being constructed as expected?
- Is the processmemory struct working as expected?

NOTE: I should really write these as actual tests, not just running tests on my testing directory myself.
