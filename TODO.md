# TODO

- Fix the relative URL situation in the headers
  - The link that's defined in header file should be relative to root, not the page being processed.
  - How to handle this?

## Thoroughly test directory processing

- Is the pagedata being constructed as expected?
- Is the processmemory struct working as expected?

NOTE: I should really write these as actual tests, not just running tests on my testing directory myself.
